# PyTorch_Notebooks
A collection of jupyter notebooks written for the lazy programmer PyTorch course. These notebooks contain a mixture of supervised and unsupervised exercises, mainly detailing ANNs, CNNs, and RNNs (with LSTMs occasionally as a treat). 

## Author's favourites:
 * PyTorch CIFAR Improved: An attempt at CIFAR multi-classification using PyTorch
 * PyTorch Nonlinear Sequence Linear/RNN/LSTM: A comparison of various techniques attempts to model the same varying time series
